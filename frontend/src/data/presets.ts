    base: 'Transform this photo into a precise architectural 3D miniature diorama. Preserve the exact spatial layout, proportions, major architectural forms, facade materials, stairs, walls, pipes, street objects, vegetation, and distinctive landmarks from the reference image.',
    style:
      'Reconstruct the scene as a clean isometric architectural model, viewed from a slightly elevated 3/4 angle, like a physical scale model placed on a square plinth. Style: high-end architectural visualization, miniature maquette, soft realistic materials, simplified but accurate geometry, subtle bevels, crisp edges, restrained detail, no exaggerated stylization. Materials should closely match the source photo but be slightly softened and desaturated: matte brick, painted metal, concrete, ceramic tile, glass, vegetation. Lighting: soft studio daylight from upper left, diffuse shadows cast onto an off-white background, ambient occlusion in corners and joints, no dramatic contrast. Background: warm off-white / ivory paper texture, minimal editorial presentation. Camera: orthographic or near-orthographic isometric view, approximately 35–45° downward angle, no wide-angle distortion. Composition: isolate only the architecture and immediate surrounding elements visible in the photo. Remove unrelated background buildings, sky, people, cars, signage, clutter, and photographic noise unless they are important to the identity of the scene. The final result should feel like a carefully handcrafted architectural scale model rendered in Blender or Cinema 4D, not like a videogame, cartoon, voxel art, or photorealistic photograph. High geometric fidelity to the reference image. Preserve asymmetry and small imperfections from the real place rather than making the architecture generic. Square base slab under the entire reconstructed scene, with soft contact shadow beneath it. No text, no labels, no typography, no border.',

    descriptionJa: '上半分に元の写真、下半分に手描きの紙のイラストを置いた縦長のポスターにする',
    subject: 'people',
    base: 'Create one independent high-end editorial poster for each uploaded photo. Do not combine multiple photos into a collage. Each photo must be processed and output as a separate poster.',
    style:
      'OVERALL FORMAT Strict 3:4 vertical composition. Divide the canvas horizontally into two exactly equal sections, with a precise 1:1 height ratio. The top half occupies exactly 50% of the canvas. The bottom half occupies exactly 50% of the canvas. The two sections should feel visually connected as one refined art publication cover. TOP HALF — ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPH Preserve the original photograph as faithfully as possible. Keep the main composition, subjects, identity, facial features, body proportions, poses, expressions, clothing, objects, and spatial relationships unchanged. Preserve the realistic photographic texture, natural lighting, shadows, atmosphere, and original color mood. Apply only subtle, sophisticated editorial color grading, creating the feeling of a premium magazine photograph, contemporary art book, or high-end independent publication. The image should remain photorealistic and authentic, never overly retouched or artificially stylized. If necessary to fit the 3:4 composition naturally, extend the sky, ground, walls, or surrounding environmental background. Background extension must feel seamless and photographic. Never stretch, distort, reshape, replace, or alter the main subject. BOTTOM HALF — MINIMAL HAND-DRAWN PAPER ILLUSTRATION Extract the most recognizable visual elements from the original photograph and reinterpret them as a minimalist hand-drawn paper-cover illustration. Preserve: The most recognizable subject Essential silhouette and proportions Key pose or gesture Important objects The core narrative relationship between people and objects Highly simplify the image. Remove unnecessary details and retain only the visual information needed for immediate recognition. Use: Delicate, slightly imperfect hand-drawn lines A small number of bold, clearly defined acrylic-style flat color shapes Rough paper texture Visible handmade brush marks Slightly irregular, organic edges Subtle imperfections that make it feel genuinely handmade The main illustrated subject should be small, centered, and carefully composed, occupying approximately 10–20% of the bottom half. Leave a large amount of negative space around the illustration. The background should primarily resemble: Rough white paper Warm off-white paper Pale natural paper Minimal editorial book-cover stock Use only a few lines or small color shapes to suggest the surrounding environment. COLOR PALETTE Extract the dominant colors directly from the original photograph. Compress the palette into no more than 4 main colors. Keep the colors restrained, sophisticated, and harmonious. Use bold but controlled flat color blocks. Avoid excessive color variation. Preserve subtle paper grain and handmade brush texture. The illustration should visually feel like a simplified color interpretation of the photograph. TYPOGRAPHY A small amount of simple typography may be included when appropriate. Possible elements: A short title Keyword Object name Location Year Number Short phrase Text should be minimal, understated, and editorial. Typography should naturally interact with the large areas of negative space and the small illustration, evoking: Art book covers Independent publishing Contemporary editorial design Thoughtful children\'s picture books Do not force text into the composition if it does not naturally fit the photograph. VISUAL LANGUAGE The final poster should feel: Quiet · Poetic · Refined · Minimal · Innocent · Relaxed · Artistic · Thoughtful · High-recognition · Premium The visual concept should be: "A small subject surrounded by a large amount of empty space." The result should resemble a carefully designed independent art publication cover, rather than a commercial advertisement.',
